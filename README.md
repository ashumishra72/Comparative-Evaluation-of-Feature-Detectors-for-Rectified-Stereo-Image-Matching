# Comparative-Evaluation-of-Feature-Detectors-for-Rectified-Stereo-Image-Matching
Stereo vision systems rely on reliable feature detection to establish accurate correspondences between left and right images. In this project, the performance of four widely used feature detectors—Harris, SURF, FAST, and BRISK—is evaluated using rectified stereo image pairs
